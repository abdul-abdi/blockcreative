## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- MongoDB instance
- Lisk Sepolia Testnet connection
- Google Gemini API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockcreative.git
   cd blockcreative
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Then edit `.env.local` with your own values.

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

6. Check the test page to verify everything is working:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/test
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Connection Issues

If you have issues connecting to MongoDB, the application is designed to fall back to mock data for development purposes. You can see the connection status on the test page at `/test`.

To ensure the MongoDB connection works:
1. Make sure your MongoDB URI in `.env.local` is correct
2. Check that your IP address is whitelisted in your MongoDB Atlas settings
3. Verify your database username and password

### CSS Loading Issues

If you experience issues with CSS not loading or seeing many 404 errors for CSS files in the console:

1. Disable the experimental `optimizeCss` feature in `next.config.js`:
   ```js
   experimental: {
     optimizeCss: false,
     // other settings...
   }
   ```

2. Clean the `.next` build directory:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   ```

3. Restart the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Smart Contracts

The platform utilizes the following smart contracts:

- **ScriptNFT**: ERC-721 contract for NFT representation of script ownership
- **ProjectRegistry**: Manages project creation and lifecycle
- **EscrowManager**: Handles fund escrow and payment processing
- **PlatformFeeManager**: Manages platform fees (3%)
